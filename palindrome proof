checking if 'RACECAR' is a palindrome 
1. Reverse the word.
2. Compare the starting word with reversed word.
3. If both words are the same, then the original word is a palindrome.
4. Following this algorithm, RACECAR is a palindrome

checking if 'DEFIED' is not a palindrome
1. Compare the first and last letters of the string.
2. If the first and last letters differ, then the string is not a palindrome.
3. Otherwise, the first and last letters are the same and this word could be a palindrome.
4. Reverse the original word and if they match, the original word is a palindrome. 
5. Following this algorithm, DEFIED is not a palindrome 

checking if any word is a palindrome

2. Otherwise, compare the first and last letters of the string.
3. If the first and last letters differ, then the string is not a palindrome.
